                            Leases can obligate you to tens of thousands of dollars. This is not the time to click accept and move on without reading. It starts with the lease application.<br>
                            <br>A landlord may ask you to fill out an application to lease their property. Read the application carefully. Look for these three key items:<br><br> 
                            <ol>
                              <li> Is there an application fee, and, if so, is it refundable if the landlord does not offer you a lease?</li> 
                              <li>What are you applying for: A specific unit? A certain size or type of unit? A space with roommates you have chosen? Or just a space, but the landlord decides what size or type or with which roommates?</li>
                              <li>Does the application require you to enter into a lease if the landlord offers it? Some applications say that if you sign the application, you're required to wait until the landlord decides whether to offer you a lease or not. And if a lease is offered, that you're required to sign it. You may have to wait months to see if you're offered space. If you decide to sign this kind of a lease application, you have to be comfortable stopping your search until you hear whether you got the apartment or not. If you sign another lease in the meantime, you could end up being obligated to two rent payments for the year.</li>
                            </ol> Ask the landlord for a blank copy of the application that you can take with you to review before signing.

                            A lease is different than many other contracts you may have signed. These contracts obligate you to a term of payments, and typically do not offer any way to cancel or buy out the obligation. When signing a lease, keep these tips in mind:

                            Read and understand the contract.
                            If the landlord makes any promises that aren't in the lease, the landlord must put those promises in writing for you to be able to hold them to it.
                            Check how empty spaces are filled. Do you have veto power over any tenant the landlord may assign to any empty rooms or beds within the apartment? Does the landlord do any kind of background check or preference matching on the individuals who might fill empty space.
                            Look for any impossible or unacceptable terms. For example: Does the landlord require you to arrange for your apartment to be inspected daily over winter break to ensure the heat is maintained at a certain level? Does the lease say that your landlord can enter your apartment at any time without giving you prior notice?
                            Know whether you are just responsible for your share of the rent (individual lease or individual rent responsibility) or can be held responsible for everyone's rent (joint and several liability).

                            Joint and several liability is a legal term that means that the landlord can choose to hold everyone (joint) or any individual person (several) responsible for liabilities under the lease like rent or damage to the apartment.

                            If you are signing a joint and several lease with two friends, all three of you are responsible for the total amount of rent on the apartment. If all of you promptly pay your share of the rent, it may never be a problem, but if one of the tenants leaves school early and stops paying rent, the landlord will typically look to the two who are still living in the apartment to try to collect the delinquent rent. And the landlord is allowed to do this. The landlord can choose to take legal action against any one, two, or all three of the tenants. For undergraduate students, landlords typically require a parent to guarantee the lease. That means that the parents are all responsible for the entire lease as well, not just their student's share.

                            When landlords offer an individual lease, each tenant signs a separate contract. An individual lease can be for an individual room or a shared room. Each tenant is individually responsible for paying only their portion of the rent.

                            If you and three friends each sign an individual lease for the same apartment, and one person stops paying rent, the landlord can only hold that one person, and that person's guarantor, responsible for the delinquent rent.

                            These individual contracts typically still assign joint and several liability for any damages to the common areas or shared bedroom or bathroom space. They typically assign individual liability for any damages to private space, like a private bedroom or bath.

                            When you lease off campus, you're leasing from a private individual or company, not the University. As with any private transaction, you'll want to be alert to scams. If you feel uncomfortable about a transaction, are being asked to send money in an odd way, or find a deal that is too good to be true, slow down and look into it further before committing money or your signature to the transaction.

                            <p><strong>Addendum</strong> &#8212; An additional document may be added to the lease in special circumstances that are not addressed in the original lease. Pet fees, cleaning fees or property maintenance fees may be examples included in an addendum.</p>
                            <p><strong>Application</strong> &#8212; A document filled out by the prospective tenant that provides the landlord with enough information to permit a credit and/or background check. There is generally a fee associated with the application and terms may include the landlord taking the property off the market.</p>
                            <p><strong>Credit Report</strong> &#8212; A report requested by a landlord identifying the prospective tenants purchasing and credit history. The purpose of the credit report is to determine the financial ability of the tenant to meet the terms of the lease.</p>
                            <p><strong>Eviction</strong> &#8212; The legal process of removing a tenant or tenants from a property for not meeting the terms of the lease.</p>
                            <p><strong>Guarantor</strong> &#8212; A person who agrees to pay the expenses should a tenant not meet the financial obligations agreed to after signing a lease. A guarantor is sometimes required when a tenant has no credit, a limited amount of credit, bad credit history or a lack of suitable income.</p>
                            <p><strong>Joint and Several Liability</strong> &#8212; A tenant and any roommate(s) are jointly responsible for any charges, rent, or damage to an apartment. The landlord has the right to pursue tenants individually or collectively to receive payment. It is important to find a trustworthy roommate because if they miss making a payment, the landlord may look to the other tenant(s) for the missing income.</p>
                            <p><strong>Lease </strong>&#8212; A legally-binding contract that defines a rental agreement between the landlord and tenant. All rent details and conditions should be included in the lease including the price, lease length, dates of move-in and move-out, and any conditions agreed upon by both parties to the lease.</p>
                            <p><strong>Lease Terms</strong> &#8212; This may have two distinct definitions. First, it could indicate the length of time the lease will be in effect. Most leases in the area are for a full 12 months. Second, terms are also the provisions of the lease. A term for allowing or not allowing pets would be an example.</p>
                            <p><strong>Landlord </strong>&#8212; The owner and/or property manager of a unit or collection of units. The landlord may also be called a lessor.</p>
                            <p><strong>Notice</strong> &#8212; Tenants must give a landlord notice as to whether they will be renewing their lease for an additional period of time or moving out at the agreed-upon date. A time frame for notifying the landlord of said decision should be defined in the lease.</p>
                            <p><strong>Ordinance </strong>&#8212; A law created by the city to address issues pertaining to city living. Noise levels, trash locations and parking locations are examples that may fall under an ordinance.</p>
                            <p><strong>Per-Bed Lease</strong> &#8212; Some landlords offer leases that are for a specific space or room in an apartment. Tenants rent the bedrooms individually and then share the common areas of the apartment.</p>
                            <p><strong>Prorated</strong> &#8212; Costs may in some cases be split based on the time living in the apartment. For example, a person moving into an apartment the last week of the month may not be required to pay for the full month, but instead pay for each day calculated out proportionately.</p>
                            <p><strong>Renters Insurance</strong> &#8212; Most landlords have insurance that covers the property but does not include tenant belongings. Renters insurance is a way for the tenant to protect himself/herself in the event of theft, fire or other scenarios that cause damage to belongings. Some leases also indicate that renters insurance is required. Tenants insurance is relatively inexpensive and can usually be purchased through home or car insurance companies.</p>
                            <p><strong>Security Deposit</strong> &#8212; An amount of money paid at lease signing to cover any damages or overages incurred while leasing the apartment.</p>
                            <p><strong>Sublease </strong>&#8212; A tenant may find a suitable person to take over the apartment and rent costs provided the landlord allows for subleasing and has conducted a credit and/or background check on the potential tenant. Tenants should contact their landlord directly to discuss subleasing options.</p>
                            <p><strong>Tenant </strong>&#8212; The person renting an apartment or house. The tenant may also be called the lessee.</p>
                            <p><strong>Waiver </strong>&#8212; Agreeing to give up a right or action defined in the lease.</p>
